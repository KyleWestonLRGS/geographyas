- *Sustainability* - Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Economic sustainability takes this concept further:

- *Economic Sustainability* - Considers the ability of economies to maintain themselves when resources decline or become too expensive and when populations dependent on these resources are growing.

## A Dilemma

- Developed countries continue to demand resources for their populations in increasing amounts.
- Less developed countries are supplying the resources that make the developed countries affluent.
- Rapidly increasing populations of developing countries are demanding more and more resources.

## Agenda 21

Agenda 21 is a UN sustainable development programme. It states that governments are obliged to formulate national plans or strategies for sustainable development. It also states that sustainable development is essentially a local activity.

## Strategies by Local Authorities

- Monitoring air and water quality.
- Promoting energy efficiency.
- Establishing effective recycling system.
- Creating efficient forms of public transport.
- Carrying out population management.

## Local Population Management

### Developing Countries:

- Training community nurses.
- Increasing female literacy rates.
- Making contraceptives readily available.

### Developed Countries

- Train sufficient personal to care for the elderly.
- Consider the issues arising from [falling birth ages, fewer children and a reduced workforce](/population/france-pro-natalism/).
