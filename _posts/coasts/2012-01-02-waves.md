Waves are a medium through which energy is transferred. They are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the sea. Frictional drag increases as the wind speed increases, making the wave bigger.

Wave energy depends upon three things:

1. The strength of the wind.
2. The length of time the wind has blown for.
3. The fetch of the wind (the distance it blows over).

## Wave Terms

| Term                    | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swash                   | A body of foaming water rushing up to the beach.                                                        |
| Wave length (L or ƛ)    | The distance between two crests (L = C × T)                                                             |
| Wave steepness (H ÷ L)  | The ratio of wave height to wave length. It cannot exceed 1:7 as at this point the wave will break.     |
| Wave velocity           | The speed of movement of a crest in a given period of time.                                             |
| Wave period (T)         | The time taken for a wave to travel through one wavelength.                                             |
| Trough                  | The lowest point of a wave.                                                                             |
| Energy (E)              | E is proportional to (L × H)<sup>2</sup>                                                                |
| Wave Height (H)         | The distance between the crest and the trough. When this exceeds 6m it is a real hazard.                |
| Crest                   | Highest point of a wave.                                                                                |
| Swell                   | Characterised by waves of low height, gentle steepness, long wavelength and a long period.              |
| Plunge line             | Where the depth of water and the height of the wave are virtually equal.                                |
| Backwash                | Water returning to the sea. It's the opposite of swash and occurs after a wave has broken onto a beach. |

## Wave Motion

When the water a wave is travelling in becomes shallow, the normal circular motion a wave travels in begins to become elliptical due to the increased friction with the sea bed. This causes the wave to slow down and causes its height to increase. As the steepness of the wave increases, it becomes less stable and, when the steepness exceeds a 7:1 (height:length) ratio, the wave breaks.

## Constructive & Destructive Waves

### Constructive/Surging Waves

![Diagram of constructive wave.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/coasts/02-waves/constructive-wave-diagram.png)

Constructive waves have a short amplitude and a long wavelength. They have a low frequency of around 6-8 waves per minute. Constructive waves produce a strong swash, but a weak backwash, which produces a gentle beach as material is deposited but not removed from the beach. The supply of new material and the constant action of pushing the material up the beach eventually produces berms.

### Destructive/Surfing Waves

Destructive waves have a high amplitude and a short wavelength. They also have a high frequency of 10-14 waves per minute. The waves have a strong backwash but a weak swash, so they remove a lot of material from the beach producing a steeper beach profile. The force of destructive waves can fire material to the back of the beach where a ridge known as a storm beach forms.
