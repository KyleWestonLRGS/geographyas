## Acknowledgements

### People

First, a huge thank you to my A-Level geography teachers Mrs Beard, Mr Wilson and Miss Rule. They're fantastic teachers and the source of a lot of this content. A further thank you to Mrs Steepe. Although she never taught me, she no doubt played an integral role in organising the Geography A-Level. Finally, a thanks to Mrs Cook---my Yr. 10/11 Geography teacher---because she convinced me to take Geography at A-Level and was fantastic throughout those two years.

### Technical

A lot of different tools make this website a hell of a lot easier to make. Here's a few of the most important ones:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [jekyll-assets](http://ixti.net/jekyll-assets/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)

[GitHub](https://pages.github.com) pages hosts this website for free. If it didn't exist, I highly doubt this website would because I developed it while playing around with GitHub pages. 

## Legal Stuff

### Plagiarism

_\*sigh\*_ Do not plagiarise. Not only are you violating the site's license, you are cheating and that is scummy. 

It isn't a good idea. I've already done my Geography A-Levels and I used a lot of this content in my essays. If you use it too, it will be flagged by plagiarism detection systems very quickly.

Here's how I'd leave attribution:

> A store is a way of storing water in a drainage basin. Thereâ€™s a couple of different types of water storage. One is _vegetation storage_. Vegetation lives off of water right? Well, any vegetation in a drainage basin will take up precipitation and store it, simple. The vegetation storage is the total volume of water stored in the vegetation in a basin at one time.
